# California Housing Prices - Simple Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project builds a **Simple Linear Regression Model** to predict housing prices based on median income from the California Housing Prices dataset.  
The goal is to understand the relationship between household income and house values through data cleaning, visualization, model building, and evaluation.

## Key Features:
- Data loading, cleaning, and inspection
- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Correlation analysis to select important features
- Simple Linear Regression model building
- Model evaluation using MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² score
- Visualization of actual vs predicted house values

## Dataset Information:
- **Source**: California Housing Prices Dataset
- **Columns**:
  - longitude, latitude, housing_median_age, total_rooms, total_bedrooms, population, households, median_income, median_house_value, ocean_proximity
